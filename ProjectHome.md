<h2>What is King's Damage Meter?</h2>

KDM is an open source damage meter for Aion Online. It parses the chat log created by the game client when logging is enabled and translates the damage done by you and those around you into a readable format. KDM will <b>not</b> help you cheat. KDM does not interact with the client nor does it read the client's memory. It will not alert you to events that occur in game or automate game play. KDM does not contain networking code and will never attempt to make a connection to the internet.

<i>KDM is written in C# and WPF and requires the .Net framework version 3.5</i>
